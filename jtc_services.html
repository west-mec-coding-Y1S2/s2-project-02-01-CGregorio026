    <!-- 
        Here, the header tag shows importance in the title. The image is added when a source is added to it, and the h2 shows the second level of importance, drawing attention to the titles of all of their services. The paragraph tags allow spacing in between the headers, while being able to display text. Finally, the footer is to show the contact info as seen on the other page, and the special characters there are caused in the same way as the mdash in the index page; adding an ampersand, giving it an alphanumerical id, and ending it in a semicolon to allow the character to be rendered on the browser.
